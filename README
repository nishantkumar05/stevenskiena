ALGORITHMS STEVEN SKIENA
------------------------

You want to know these things about algorithms:
- What problem does algorithm solves? 
- And how efficiently? Best, average and worst case time complexities?
- Use cases of algorithm. Which algorithm best in which case


Chapter 2
------------------------

A- Factors influencing algorithm choice
   Complexity
   - Runtime complexity (Big-O notation)
   - Space complexity
     = In-place
     = Algos with locality of reference in L1 or L2 cache

   Input data
   - Data size
   - Data structure in which data is stored
   - data distribution (Insertion sort is better than selection if data is already sorted)


B- Stable sort?
   Any sorting algorithm that doesn't change input data if it considers two items as equal.
   
   Sort (2,blue) , (3,red) , (4,red), (9,green), (1,red) by colors in red > blue > green order. 
   Stable sort in this case will make syre that items (3,red) and (4,red) doesnt change in final output
