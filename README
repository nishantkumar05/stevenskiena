ALGORITHMS STEVEN SKIENA
------------------------

You want to know these things about algorithms:
- What problem does algorithm solves? 
- And how efficiently? Best, average and worst case time complexities?
- Use cases. Which algorithm best in which case


MACHINE:
-----------------------
MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013
Processor 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7
Memory 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB

TESTS
-----------------------
32M = how long does it take to test on 32 million sample size
32K = how long does it take to test on 32 thousand sample size

time mentioned in the report following is retrieved from time utility and its 'user time' (not real or sys time).

            Insert        Search
